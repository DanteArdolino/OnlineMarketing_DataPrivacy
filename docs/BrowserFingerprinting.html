        Web pages consist of HTML (the structure of the page, a language used to tell a web browser how the page should
        look, used in fonts, links, typographical emphasis, images, alignment, etc.) and CSS  (the visual and aural
        layout, gives specifications to the style of the documents including layouts, colors, fonts, etc.) and
        javascript (web programming language, powers things like google docs, facebook, consists of the actions on the
        internet like a menu opening upon clicking.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The so called fingerprint of a browser is a unique ID that is generated that can be used to identify your
        particular browser on the computer. Using Java, websites can obtain vital information such as the resolution
        of the screen as well as the orientation which could be used to  know if someone had a smartphone and what
        landscape it was being held. Java also allows bits of info like what web browser, OS , type of electronic
        possibly make and model Timezone default language, browser plugins installed. Java creates a hash (known as the browser fingerprint)
        of the collected data which sends it to the server which is then stored in the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        All that needs to be done is go to the website malicious javascript code and users will not know it is
        running in the background. There are certain things like the Font test that run a java code and it draws a box
        unknowing to users, write a word or letters and draws box and looks at what browser has drawn and can see the
        variations in the way it renders text to get certain information , as each computer renders text differently.
        The way one computer writes letters differs from others, and can know exactly how that computer draws a certain
        letter after running the code.
      </p>
      <p>

        All of these may seem minute but it's the combination of all of these unique bits of information that adds
        together that allows. Can gather a unique code that can just be sent up to their server. Websites with
        javascript code such as Google analytic Facebook like button, if they did browser fingerprinting doesn't
        matter if logged in or not, if in private browsing mode they would know your unique ID.
